# AbstractionPractice

we are writing a program that represents the employees of a company

There are common features such as name, surname, department for each employee

However, the job (position) of each employee may be different (For example, Software Developer, Project Manager, Sales Representative).

When we call the Task method, each employee's own work is printed on the console screen

For example

Hasan Çıldırmış is the Project Manager of the company, when the Task() abstract method is called on him, we want

"I work as a project manager." to be printed on the console screen.

*** This project coded C#
